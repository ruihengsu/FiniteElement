# FiniteElement

These are a collection of some of small projects related to the finite element method. You can find notes, animations, and source codes.

### Directories

"`UofMichigan FEM Course`"
- 185+ pages of course notes
- Course completion certificate
- Solutions to linear elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic PDEs for scalar and vector unknowns, in one to three dimensions.

"`FEniCS Demo`"
- Working through official FEniCS demos
- Source code + animations

"`FEniCS Tutorial`"
- Working through a tutorial from 2016
- Source code + animations

"`Wave Equation`"
- Solving the wave equation in 2D over a slightly more complicated domain
- Source code + animations
- Time discretization using the Newmark family of algorithms. There is something wrong, but I can't figure out what it might be.

"`Capacitor`"
- Solving a textbook question using FEM
- Capacitors are modelled as 2D surface charge distributions
- Visualize the fringing fields

"`Helmholtz coils`"
- Under development
